## 1. Company background and scenario

### 1.1 Overview
A34Build is a general contractor handling civil infrastructure, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities. The company runs multiple active projects at the same time across different sites. Each project has fixed deadlines, strict budgets, and safety requirements. Daily work involves field engineers, site managers, equipment operators, heavy machinery, specialized subcontractors, and tons of building materials.

The company currently relies on spreadsheets and paper logs. This causes scheduling delays, budget overruns, inventory loss at job sites, and slow cost tracking. The goal is to build a centralized relational database to manage projects, staff, equipment, materials, subcontracts, and site safety.

### 1.2 Main business operations
The database covers seven main operational areas:
1. **Projects:** Client contracts, job sites, phases, and task schedules.
2. **Workforce:** Job roles, reporting hierarchy, certifications, and task assignments.
3. **Equipment:** Owned and leased machinery, site deployments, run hours, and maintenance logs.
4. **Materials:** Suppliers, purchase orders, site deliveries, and stock levels.
5. **Subcontractors:** Trade specialties, contract agreements, and safety ratings.
6. **Project costs:** Budget tracking against spending on labor, equipment, materials, and subcontracts.
7. **Safety:** Safety rules, inspection scores, and incident reports.

## 4. Business rules

### 4.1 Domain constraints
- Amounts must be positive (> 0): `Salary`, `Budget`, `PhaseBudget`, `ContractValue`, `StandardUnitPrice`, `AgreedUnitPrice`, `Cost`.
- Quantities must be non-negative (>= 0): `QuantityOrdered`, `DeliveredQuantity`, `CurrentStockQuantity`.
- Status and classification fields use fixed values:
  - `PROJECT.Status`: Planned, In-Progress, Suspended, Completed
  - `PROJECT_PHASE.PhaseStatus`: Pending, Active, Under-Inspection, Accepted
  - `TASK.TaskStatus`: Pending, In_Progress, Completed, Blocked
  - `EQUIPMENT.CurrentStatus`: Available, Deployed, Under-Maintenance, Retired
  - `PURCHASE_ORDER.DeliveryStatus`: Issued, Partial_Delivery, Fulfilled, Cancelled
  - `SAFETY_INSPECTION.InspectionResult`: Passed, Conditional_Pass, Failed
  - `INCIDENT_REPORT.SeverityLevel`: Near-Miss, First-Aid, Lost-Time-Injury, Fatal

### 4.2 Date and time rules
- End dates cannot be earlier than start dates (`StartDate <= PlannedEndDate`, `StartDate <= ActualEndDate`).
- Workers must be at least 18 years old (`CurrentDate - DOB >= 18` and `HireDate >= DOB + 18`).
- Task start and end dates must fall within the dates of the parent project phase.

### 4.3 Rules not modeled in ERD
These rules cannot be shown with ER notation and will be enforced through triggers, check constraints, or application logic:
1. **Phase budget limit:** The sum of all phase budgets in a project cannot exceed the project's estimated budget.
2. **No overlapping machine bookings:** A piece of equipment cannot be scheduled at two different sites during overlapping dates.
3. **Operator licensing:** An employee assigned to run heavy equipment must have the required license listed in their certifications.
4. **Daily work limit:** A worker cannot log more than 12 hours total across all tasks in a single day.
5. **No circular task dependencies:** The `PRECEDES` relationship between tasks must not create cycles.
6. **Stock limit on consumption:** Tasks cannot consume more material than the current stock recorded at that site.
7. **Single project limit for directors:** An employee can be the director of only one active project at a time.
8. **Accident emergency notification:** When an incident involves an employee, the system must trigger a notification looking up their emergency contact in `DEPENDENT` where `IsEmergencyContact = true`.

---

## 5. Database applications

### 5.1 Data loading
- Import the standard material catalog with units and benchmark prices.
- Add new employees, job titles, and verified licenses.
- Set up new project contracts, site locations, and milestone schedules.
- Register newly purchased or leased machinery with serial numbers.

### 5.2 Updates
- Log daily worker hours on specific tasks.
- Record material deliveries arriving at a site and update on-site inventory counts.
- Deduct materials used during daily work from site inventory.
- Update equipment operating hours and switch status to maintenance when service intervals arrive.
- Mark project phases as completed after inspection sign-off.
- Log site safety audit scores and incident reports.

### 5.3 Queries
- Find heavy equipment by category that is available and not booked for the next two weeks.
- Check which materials at a specific site have dropped below their reorder threshold.
- List tasks on the critical path that are past their scheduled end date.
- Look up the reporting chain of an employee up to the general director.
- View active subcontractors on a project with their contracted amounts and remaining retention balances.

### 5.4 Reports
- **Cost vs. budget variance:** Compares the initial project budget against total spending on labor, equipment, materials, and subcontracts.
- **Earned value analysis:** Computes Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), Actual Cost (AC), Cost Performance Index (CPI), and Schedule Performance Index (SPI).
- **Site safety report:** Summarizes audit scores, open safety issues, lost work days, and total injury-free hours per site.
- **Subcontractor scorecard:** Ranks subcontractors by delivery speed, work quality, and safety compliance.
- **Fleet utilization report:** Shows machine run hours against idle hours and maintenance costs per operating hour.
